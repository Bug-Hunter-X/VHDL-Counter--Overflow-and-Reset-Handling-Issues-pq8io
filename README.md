# VHDL Counter Bug Report and Solution

This repository contains a VHDL counter design with a potential overflow issue and incorrect reset handling.  The original code (`counter.vhdl`) is prone to errors when dealing with unexpected input.  The improved version (`counter_fixed.vhdl`) addresses these issues.

## Bug Description
The original counter has potential problems in two areas:

1. **Overflow:**  The counter does not explicitly check for conditions that might lead to values outside the defined range (0 to 15).   
2. **Reset Handling:** There might be issues in how the reset signal interacts with the counting logic. The current implementation might not work correctly under every reset scenario. 

## Solution
The improved counter (`counter_fixed.vhdl`) incorporates several changes to address these problems:

* More robust reset handling to ensure the counter always starts at 0 when reset is asserted.
* Explicit checks to handle potential values outside the expected range of the counter.

This example highlights the importance of thorough testing and robust design in VHDL for preventing subtle, hard-to-find issues.
